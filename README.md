# RssWebApplication

# Thia Application provide two APIs which are used to retrieve news from news agency using RSS protocol.
First of all you must add Feed by using POST method and send a name and a link. this link must owned by a news agency like yahoo, bbc, etc. (e.g:https://sports.yahoo.com/sc/rss.xml)
Then you can get retrieved news by send a GET request. You can set limitation for the news count by send a request param named "limit" and pass an integer value.
GOOD LUCK
